    I am a PhD student at the the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon. My advisor is Srinivasa Narasimhan. I was previously a Masters student at the Field Robotics Center at CMU working with Sanjiv Singh. 

    I am interested in computer vision and robotics. My current work involves designing algorithms and hardware that make active illumination sensing possible under challenging, real world conditions.

    <p>We have recently built a portable, low power <a href = http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ILIM/episcan3d>depth camera</a> that works in bright sunlight, can scan difficult objects and can image through light fog.

          The Grape Project: The goal of this ongoing project is to make a computer vision system that can automatically estimate the yield of a vineyard by visual inspection. Attach a camera to a tractor, drive it down each row of vines in a vineyard and the system should output an estimate for the weight of grapes growing on each vine. Solving this problem requires a means for registering images and an accurate method for detecting grape clusters on branches. Occlusions from leaves are a major challenge and we are investigating the use of active illumination and synthetic aperture methods to help with this problem. A video with some preliminary detection results is <a href = videos/grape_high.mp4>here</a> (high quality 25MB) and <a href = videos/grape_low.mp4>here</a> (compact 5MB).
